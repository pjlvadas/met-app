What is this?

The Awesome Met App is the coolest way to enjoy The Metropolitan Museum of Art's virtual collection. Create a profile to start a personalized gallery of the Met's artworks, then add comments to these pieces to record your reflections. Gather details on where specific works of art are located in the Met's galleries, and stay up to date with events at the Met as the New York Times reports them.
